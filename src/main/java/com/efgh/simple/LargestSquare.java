 * Given a two dimensional matrix made up of 0's and 1's, write a method largestSquare to find the largest square containing all 1â€™s and return its area.
 * The area is simply the sum of all integers enclosed in the square.
 *
 * Example
 * Input Matrix :
 *
 * 1101     xxxx    11xx
 * 1101  => 11xx or 11xx
 * 1111     11xx    xxxx
 *
 * Output  : 4
